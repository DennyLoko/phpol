# Bylaws.

This project is comprised of voluntary contributors, recruited from the community at large. 
A full list of contributors should be available in the [contributors file](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Voting protocol.

As of this initial stage, only listed contributors can cast a vote on issues. Votes are cast
with github reactions (:+1: or :-1:) and self-declared abstentions.

Issues will be voted for either two days or until every voting contributor has cast a vote, whatever
comes first. 

The definition of consensus and minimum voting quorum may vary, depending on the nature of the issue, 
according the following:

1) Bylaw changes and general contribution guidelines require a 2/3 of voters quorum, with a minimum of 2/3
of favourable votes to be approved.
2) API changes (either modification or adding of new features) require a 50% of votes quorum and 50% + 1 of 
total votes to be favourable.

Fixing typos and general clarifications require no voting, only a Pull Request with 2 members approval.
